# COMS 3102 Final Project

## Tutorial used

https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/fetching-data
I did not follow the tutorial but modified it as I went through it to create the app I wanted to create.

## Features I want to be ✨graded on✨

- Two options for note persistance: cookies and auth
  - Cookies: visitors to the site start as guests. A user id is generated for them and stored on their browser as a cookie. They can create notes and view them as long as they don't clear their cookies.
  - Auth: visitors to the site can sign up and log in using OAUTH. They can always access their notes as long as they are logged in.
  - When a guest registers, their notes are automatically transferred to their new account so they do not lose any data from their guest account.
